## Support Vector Machine (SVM) Overview
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is widely used for classification problems and works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.

## Key Concepts
### Hyperplane

> + In SVM, the hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates different classes.
> + For 2D data, it's a line; for 3D data, it's a plane; and for higher dimensions, it's a hyperplane.

### Support Vectors

> + These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane.
> + They are critical in defining the position and orientation of the hyperplane.

### Margin

> + The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from either class.
> + SVM maximizes this margin, aiming for better generalization.
